Write a PL/SQL code block to calculate the area of a circle for a value of radius varying from 5 to 9. Store the radius and the corresponding values of calculated area in an empty table named areas, consisting of two columns, radius and area



create table circlearea(radius int,area int);
select * from circlearea;
edit a1.sql

pi:=3.14;
for r1 in 5..9
loop
cir_area:=pi*(r1*r1);
insert into circlearea values(r1,cir_area);
end loop;
end;
