Design and Develop SQL DDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym.

employee (person name, street, city)
works (person name, company name, salary)
company (company name, city) 
branch (branch name, branch city, assets) 
customer (customer name, customer street, customer city)
loan (loan number, branch name, amount)
 borrower (customer name, loan number) 
account (account number, branch name, balance) 
depositor (customer name, account number)

Create view with the Customer name, customer street  by using above tables.
 Create index for loan number.
Create sequence for account & insert 4 records using sequence.
Create the synonym for table depositor & borrower. Display the record using this table. Update the record using the synonym tables.
Drop synonym for depositor table.
